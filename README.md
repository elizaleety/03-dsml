# Data Analysis on E-commerce Review Scoring Project

## ðŸ“Š Data Analysis
A data analysis project to solve case problems with machine learning model using Python.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objective
Understanding cases, applying machine learning methods(KNN, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Decision Tree) and analysing results to help data-driven decision-making.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries
Python (Pandas, Numpy)
Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ“Š Data
The dataset includes tables such as orders_data, orders_review, order_item, order_customer, product_data, order_payment, geoloc_data ...etc

## ðŸ§ª Key Insights
1. Although the random forest model currently selected performs best, there is still room for improvement in accuracy and precision.
2. Low precision means that there are still many false positives (FP), which means that promotional information may be sent to some customers who actually give low score, bringing potential risks.
3. It is recommended to gradually promote it based on small-scale testing to reduce negative impacts.
4. Improvement
   4.1 Additional features engineering
   4.2 Introducing PCA
   4.3 Label Redefinition and Balancing the Dataset
